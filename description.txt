Elemental Hearts: Labor of Love is a revival of Elemental Hearts mod, that was made by Lite, also known as Vincent Jenei.
Vincent Jenei disappeared after April 13th and didn't updated the mod after.
But now we doing our own take on this mod.

We COMPLETELY rewrote old way, and now its better for whole 3 reasons:
1. Better readability.
2. Open-source. (Everyone can contribute and learn!)
3. Completely new sprites for most hearts.

You can use any sprite from this mod as long as you credit us.
